# 🤖 CCTV Interview Chatbot (Work in Progress)

The **CCTV Interview Chatbot** is an AI-powered system designed to automate and streamline HR interviews and financial transactions. It uses advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models to provide accurate and context-aware responses, reducing manual workloads, enhancing decision-making, and improving the overall productivity of HR and finance departments.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated HR Interviews**: Conducts interviews, evaluates responses, and provides initial feedback to HR teams.
- **Financial Transactions Support**: Handles inquiries about financial transactions and processes them with minimal human intervention.
- **Entity Recognition**: Extracts key information (e.g., names, dates, amounts) using **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assesses the sentiment of candidates' responses during interviews to provide HR with deeper insights.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Uses a cloud-based solution for deployment, ensuring scalability and high performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing**:
  - Pre-trained models like **GPT** and **BERT** for generating conversational responses.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model for integrating external knowledge sources like company policies and financial regulations.
  - **Sentiment Analysis** for analyzing candidate responses.
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for extracting relevant information from interview and financial data.

- **Backend**:
  - **Flask** or **Django** for the server-side logic.
  - RESTful APIs using **FastAPI** for handling requests and responses between the client and server.

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js** or **Angular** for building an intuitive, user-friendly web interface.

- **Database**:
  - **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** for storing HR records, transaction logs, and user interactions.

- **Deployment**:
  - Hosted on **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure** for scalability and reliability.
  - **Redis** or **Memcached** for caching frequently accessed data to ensure faster response times.

## 📋 How to Install and Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-3 integration)
- Basic knowledge of Flask or Django and NLP tools

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interview-chatbot.git
   cd interview-chatbot```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables**: <br />
Set your OpenAI API key in your environment:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
    ```
    Run the chatbot server:

    ```bash
    python src/chatbot.py
    ```
    Access the chatbot: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to interact with the chatbot.

💡 Usage
The chatbot is designed to take text input from users, process it using NLP, and generate a meaningful response. Here are examples of possible interactions:

Example 1 - HR Interview: Request:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Can you conduct an interview for a software engineer?"
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "response": "Sure! Let’s start with the first question: What are your greatest strengths as a software engineer?"
}
Example 2 - Financial Transaction: Request:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Can you help me process a refund?"
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "response": "I’ve initiated a refund request for you. It should be processed within 3-5 business days."
}
🛠️ Development Setup
Frontend
The frontend is built with React.js to provide an intuitive interface where users can interact with the chatbot via text. For installation and development, you’ll need:

bash
Copy code
npm install
npm start
You can also integrate WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates on long-running transactions or interviews.

Backend
The backend is built using Flask or Django, with RESTful APIs to handle client requests and interface with the NLP models. To run the backend:

bash
Copy code
python src/chatbot.py
🧑‍💻 Future Enhancements
Voice Integration: Add support for voice-based interviews using speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs.
Real-time Transaction Updates: Integrate real-time updates for financial transactions using WebSockets.
User Authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth2, for user management and data privacy.
Advanced Analytics: Provide detailed analytics to HR teams based on interview responses, candidate performance, and sentiment analysis.
